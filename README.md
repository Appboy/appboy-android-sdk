## Remote repository for gradle
The version should match the git version tag, or the most recent version noted in the changelog. An example dependency declaration is:

```
repositories {
   maven { url "https://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/sdk" }
   ...
}
```

```
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.appboy:android-sdk-ui:11.0.+'
   ...
}
```

## Installing android-sdk-ui to Your Local Maven Repository
To install the UI library as an AAR file to your local maven repository, run the `install` task with
`./gradlew install`. You can reference it with groupId `com.appboy` and artifactId `android-sdk-ui`. The version should
match the git version tag, or the most recent version noted in the changelog. An example dependency declaration is:

```
repositories {
   mavenLocal()
   ...
}
```

```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.appboy:android-sdk-ui:11.0.+'
}
```

## Building and Running the Sample Applications

1. Make sure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable is set to the location of your installed SDK or you have a
   local.properties file which defines the sdk.dir property. You can check this by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME`, or
   `echo %ANDROID_HOME%` in Windows.
2. To assemble the UI library and the Droidboy APK, run `./gradlew assemble` (use gradlew.bat on Windows). You can find
   assembled files in the `build/` subdirectories of the `android-sdk-ui` and `droidboy` projects. You can also
   use the `installDebug` task if you have a device or emulator connected to adb and want to run Droidboy or Hello-Appboy.
   You can see other available tasks by running `./gradlew tasks`.
