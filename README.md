## Components

- `android-sdk-base` - the Braze SDK base analytics library.
- `android-sdk-ui` - the Braze SDK user interface library for in-app messages, push, and the news feed.
- `droidboy` - a sample app demonstrating how to use Braze in-depth.
- `hello-appboy` - a sample app demonstrating a basic Braze integration.
- `china-push-sample` - a sample app demonstrating the Braze + Baidu push integration.
- `android-sdk-unity` - a library that enables Braze SDK integrations on Unity.
- `samples` - a folder containing several sample apps for various integration options.

## Building and Running the Sample Applications

1. Make sure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable is set to the location of your installed SDK or you have a
   local.properties file which defines the sdk.dir property. You can check this by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME`, or
   `echo %ANDROID_HOME%` in Windows.
2. To assemble the UI library and the Droidboy APK, run `./gradlew assemble` (use gradlew.bat on Windows). You can find
   assembled files in the `build/` subdirectories of the `android-sdk-ui` and `droidboy` projects. You can also
   use the `installDebug` task if you have a device or emulator connected to adb and want to run Droidboy or Hello-Appboy.
   You can see other available tasks by running `./gradlew tasks`.

## Remote repository for gradle
The version should match the git version tag, or the most recent version noted in the changelog. An example dependency declaration is:

```
repositories {
   maven { url "http://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/sdk" }
   ...
}
```

```
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.appboy:android-sdk-ui:2.2.+'
   ...
}
```

## Installing android-sdk-ui to Your Local Maven Repository
To install the UI library as an AAR file to your local maven repository, run the `install` task with
`./gradlew install`. You can reference it with groupId `com.appboy` and artifactId `android-sdk-ui`. The version should
match the git version tag, or the most recent version noted in the changelog. An example dependency declaration is:


```
repositories {
   mavenLocal()
   ...
}
```

```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.appboy:android-sdk-ui:2.2.+'
}
```

## Version Support

The Android SDK supports Android 4.0+ (Ice Cream Sandwich and up).

Braze uses [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) 4.3.0 for in-app message icons. Check out the [cheat sheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/) to browse available icons.

Braze requires either a custom [IAppboyImageLoader](http://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/javadocs/com/appboy/IAppboyImageLoader.html) or Facebook's [Fresco image library](https://github.com/facebook/fresco) to display animated `gif` images. Fresco is not included nor enabled by default in the Braze library, and must be included and enabled explicitly by the parent app. Braze supports Fresco 0.6.0 through 1.3.0.
