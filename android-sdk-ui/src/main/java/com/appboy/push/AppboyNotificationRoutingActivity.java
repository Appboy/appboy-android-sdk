/**
 * This class merely acts as a liaison between notification action buttons and opening Activities directly
 * from the lock screen. Having the notification action button deeplink intent go directly to the
 * {@link AppboyNotificationUtils#getNotificationReceiverClass()} does not prompt the user to open
 * the phone from behind a lockscreen. Deeplinking to this liaison solves that.
 * <br>
 * However note that any deeplink to this {@link Activity} will also open the host app. For example,
 * if the origin deeplink is intended to close a notification, deeplinking to this {@link Activity} will
 * also open the app, which is likely not intended.
